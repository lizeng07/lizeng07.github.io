I am a Master's Student at ETH Zurich where I worked with groups of [Energy and Technology Policy Group](https://epg.ethz.ch/) and [Climate Finance and Policy Group](http://cfp.ethz.ch). In both groups, I did my master's thesis and several research projects related to sustainable technologies, economics and policy.

Originally my initial training was in materials engineering, where I had worked on the experimental research of energy and electronic materials. Then I had over one year of experience in equity and project financing, in the sector of energy and resources. I started to think one question: how can technologies benefit the society?

Then my current research turns into the analysis of the relationship between Technologies (Energy & Carbon Removal) and Societies (Economics & Policy). I use Python and R scripting for my projects, but I will also go visiting facilities and conduct interviews with experts to gain the most frontier insights to shape my research. 

Aside from research, I like to spend my spare time doing some sports and taking pictures, which you can find on this website.
