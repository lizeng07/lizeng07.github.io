I am a Master's Student at ETH Zurich where I worked with [Energy and Technology Policy Group](https://epg.ethz.ch/) and [Climate Finance and Policy Group](http://cfp.ethz.ch). In both groups, I did my master's thesis and several research projects related to sustainable technologies, economics and policy.

Originally, my background was in materials engineering, where I conducted experimental research of energy and electronic materials. After that, I gained over a year of experience in equity and project financing in the energy and resources sector. These experiences led me to reflect on two important questions:  

(1)How can technologies benefit society?  
(2)How can I contribute to this?

Currently, my research focuses on analyzing the relationship between technologies (energy and carbon removal) and society (economics and policy). I use Python and R for data analysis in my projects, but I also visit facilities and conduct interviews with experts to gain cutting-edge insights that shape my research. 

Beyond research, I enjoy spending my spare time engaging in sports and photography, some of which is showcased on this website.
