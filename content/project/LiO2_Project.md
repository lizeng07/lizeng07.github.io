## Abstract
Improving the lifetime of batteries is one of the most challenging problems in energy storage. One way to pursue good cycling performance for lithium-oxygen $(\text{Li-}\text{O}_2)$ batteries is to achieve low charge overpotentials. Here, ordered mesoporous carbon materials (CMK-8) are rationally designed as an oxygen cathode for $\text{Li-} \text{O}_2$ batteries to reduce the charge overpotential and lengthen the cycle life. Due to the ordered mesoporous features, CMK-8 not only provides abundant channels for the transportation of $\text{Li}^+$ and $\text{O}_2$ by capillary force but also acts as a block to prevent lithium superoxide $(\text{Li} \text{O}_2)$ from diffusing during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process due to its unique cubic Ia3d structure. Therefore, amorphous lithium peroxide $(\text{Li}_2 \text{O}_2)$ can form in the pore interiors of CMK-8. Such designed catalysts enable excellent electrochemical performance due to improved conductivity in amorphous $\text{Li}_2 \text{O}_2$ and the good $\text{Li}_2 \text{O}_2$/CMK-8 contact interface. Finally, at a current density of 100 mA/g, the CMK-8 electrode delivers a low charge overpotential of 0.43 V without any obvious degradation even after 45 cycles with a limited capacity of 500 mAh/g.
