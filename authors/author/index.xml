      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Master&amp;rsquo;s Student at ETH Zurich where I worked with groups of &lt;a href=&#34;https://epg.ethz.ch/&#34;&gt;Energy and Technology Policy Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cfp.ethz.ch&#34;&gt;Climate Finance and Policy Group&lt;/a&gt;. In both groups, I did my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis and several research projects related to sustainable technologies, economics and policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally my initial training was in materials engineering, where I had worked on the experimental research of energy and electronic materials. Then I had over one year of experience in equity and project financing, in the sector of energy and resources. I started to think one question: how can technologies benefit the society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my current research turns into the analysis of the relationship between Technologies (Energy &amp;amp; Carbon Removal) and Societies (Economics &amp;amp; Policy). I use Python and R scripting for my projects, but I will also go visiting facilities and conduct interviews with experts to gain the most frontier insights to shape my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from research, I like to spend my spare time doing some sports and taking pictures, which you can find on this website.&lt;/p&gt;
