      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Master&amp;rsquo;s Student at ETH Zurich where I worked with &lt;a href=&#34;https://epg.ethz.ch/&#34;&gt;Energy and Technology Policy Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cfp.ethz.ch&#34;&gt;Climate Finance and Policy Group&lt;/a&gt;. In both groups, I did my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis and several research projects related to sustainable technologies, economics and policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, my background was in materials engineering, where I conducted experimental research of energy and electronic materials. After that, I gained over a year of experience in equity and project financing in the energy and resources sector. These experiences led me to reflect on two important questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)How can technologies benefit society?&lt;br&gt;
(2)How can I contribute to this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, my research focuses on analyzing the relationship between technologies (energy and carbon removal) and society (economics and policy). I use Python and R for data analysis in my projects, but I also visit facilities and conduct interviews with experts to gain cutting-edge insights that shape my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond research, I enjoy spending my spare time engaging in sports and photography, some of which is showcased on this website.&lt;/p&gt;
