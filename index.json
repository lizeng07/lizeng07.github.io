One way to pursue good cycling performance for lithium-oxygen (Li2O2) batteries is to achieve low charge overpotentials. Here, ordered mesoporous carbon materials (CMK-8) are rationally designed as an oxygen cathode for Li-O2 batteries to reduce the charge overpotential and lengthen the cycle life. Due to the ordered mesoporous features, CMK-8 not only provides abundant channels for the transportation of Li+ and O2 by capillary force but also acts as a block to prevent lithium superoxide (LiO2) from diffusing during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process due to its unique cubic Ia3d structure. Therefore, amorphous lithium peroxide (Li2O2) can form in the pore interiors of CMK-8. Such designed catalysts enable excellent electrochemical performance due to improved conductivity in amorphous Li2O2 and the good Li2O2/CMK-8 contact interface. Finally, at a current density of 0.1 A g^-1, the CMK-8 electrode delivers a low charge overpotential of 0.43 V without any obvious degradation even after 45 cycles with a limited capacity of 500 mAh g^-1.\nProject Images Here are some images related to the project:\nExample Image 1: Example Image 2: Project Downloads You can download the related PDF file here:\nDownload Project Report More Information Feel free to get in touch to have further discussion.\n","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"7c96c21daa1611f4dde300aa194e593b","permalink":"https://lizeng07.github.io/project/lio2_project/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lio2_project/","section":"project","summary":"This project designs ordered mesoporous carbon materials (CMK-8) as oxygen cathodes for lithium-oxygen batteries to achieve low charge overpotentials and improved cycle life by enhancing Li+ and O2 transport and controlling Li2O2 formation.","tags":["Materials Engineering"],"title":"Li-Oxygen Battery Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0a1dba2c018da9739261513564b54760","permalink":"https://lizeng07.github.io/authors/authors/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/authors/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":null,"type":"authors"}]
