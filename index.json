Complexity and fast-growing data in microbiome study also push me to learn a lot of new skills, which are a fascinating process.

I love singing, Balinese dancing, and trying new food recipes.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0130dff4234ceaca9e707a941f1ba38e","permalink":"https://erawijantari.github.io/authors/authors/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/authors/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Turku where I worked with group of Turku Hypertension Center and Turku Data Science Group.
