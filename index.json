One way to pursue good cycling performance for lithium-oxygen $(\\text{Li-}\\text{O}_2)$ batteries is to achieve low charge overpotentials. Here, ordered mesoporous carbon materials (CMK-8) are rationally designed as an oxygen cathode for $\\text{Li-} \\text{O}_2$ batteries to reduce the charge overpotential and lengthen the cycle life. Due to the ordered mesoporous features, CMK-8 not only provides abundant channels for the transportation of $\\text{Li}^+$ and $\\text{O}_2$ by capillary force but also acts as a block to prevent lithium superoxide $(\\text{Li} \\text{O}_2)$ from diffusing during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process due to its unique cubic Ia3d structure. Therefore, amorphous lithium peroxide $(\\text{Li}_2 \\text{O}_2)$ can form in the pore interiors of CMK-8. Such designed catalysts enable excellent electrochemical performance due to improved conductivity in amorphous $\\text{Li}_2 \\text{O}_2$ and the good $\\text{Li}_2 \\text{O}_2$/CMK-8 contact interface. Finally, at a current density of 100 mA/g, the CMK-8 electrode delivers a low charge overpotential of 0.43 V without any obvious degradation even after 45 cycles with a limited capacity of 500 mAh/g.\nKey Images Here are some interesting images related to the project:\nMaterials Characterization: CMK-8: (a)The discharge-charge profile of $\\text{Li-} \\text{O}_2$ batteries with CMK-8 cathode; (b)-(f) TEM images of the CMK-8 cathode taken at each typical point in (a)\nBatteries Performance Comparison: CMK-8 vs. EC-300J: (a) \u0026amp; (b) The cycling performance;\n(c) \u0026amp; (d) The Nyquist plot\nReport Downloads You can download the related PDF file here:\nDownload Project Report More Information Feel free to get in touch to have further discussion.\n","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"7c96c21daa1611f4dde300aa194e593b","permalink":"https://lizeng07.github.io/project/lio2_project/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lio2_project/","section":"project","summary":"Designed and conducted chemical experiments on next the generation battery","tags":["Materials Engineering"],"title":"Li-Oxygen Battery Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0a1dba2c018da9739261513564b54760","permalink":"https://lizeng07.github.io/authors/authors/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/authors/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":null,"type":"authors"}]
