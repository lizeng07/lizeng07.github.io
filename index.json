My current research turns into the analysis of the relationship between technologies (Energy \u0026amp; Carbon Removal) and societies (Economic \u0026amp; Policy). I use Python and R scripting for my projects, but I will also go visiting facilities and conduct interview with experts to gain the most frontier insights to shape my research.\nAside from research, I like to spend my spare time doing some sports and taking pictures, which you can find on this website.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0130dff4234ceaca9e707a941f1ba38e","permalink":"https://lizeng07.github.io/authors/authors/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/authors/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Master\u0026rsquo;s Student at ETH Zurich where I worked with group of Energy and Technology Policy Group and Climate Finance and Policy Group.
